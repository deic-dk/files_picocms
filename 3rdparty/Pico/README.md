Install
-------

You can install Pico either using a pre-bundled release or with composer. Pico is also available on [Packagist.org][] and may be included in other projects via `composer require picocms/pico`. Pico requires PHP 5.3+

#### Using a pre-bundled release

Just [download the latest Pico release][LatestRelease] and upload all files to the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html`) of your server.

#### Composer

###### Step 1 - for users
[Download the *source code* of Pico's latest release][LatestRelease], upload all files to the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html`) of your server and navigate to the upload directory using a shell.

###### Step 1 - for developers
Open a shell and navigate to the desired install directory of Pico within the `httpdocs` directory (e.g. `/var/www/html`) of your server. You can now clone Pico's Git repository as follows:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/picocms/Pico.git .
```
Please note that this gives you the current development version of Pico, what is likely *unstable* and *not ready for production use*!

###### Step 2
Download [composer][] and run it with the `install` option:
```shell
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

Upgrade
-------

Upgrading Pico is very easy: You just have to replace all of Pico's files - that's it! Nevertheless you should *always* create a backup of your Pico installation before upgrading.

Pico follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0][SemVer] and uses version numbers like `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`. When we update...

- the `PATCH` version (e.g. `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`), we made backwards-compatible bug fixes. It's then sufficient to extract [Pico's latest release][LatestRelease] to your existing installation directory and overwriting all files. Alternatively you can either use the [*source code* of Pico's latest release][LatestRelease] or pull from Pico's Git repository, but are then required to update Pico's [composer][] dependencies manually by running `php composer.phar update`.

- the `MINOR` version (e.g. `1.0` to `1.1`), we added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, but anyway recommend you to "install" Pico newly. Backup all of your files, empty your installation directory and install Pico as elucidated above. You can then copy your `config/config.php` and `content` directory without any change. If applicable, you can also copy the folder of your custom theme within the `themes` directory. Provided that you're using plugins, also copy all of your plugins from the `plugins` directory.

- the `MAJOR` version (e.g. `1.0` to `2.0`), we made incompatible API changes. We will then provide a appropriate upgrade tutorial.

Upgrading Pico 0.8 or 0.9 to Pico 1.0 is a special case. The new `PicoDeprecated` plugin ensures backwards compatibility, so you basically can follow the above upgrade instructions as if we updated the `MINOR` version. However, we recommend you to take some further steps to confine the necessity of `PicoDeprecated` as far as possible. For more information about what has changed with Pico 1.0 and a step-by-step upgrade tutorial, please refer to the [upgrade page of our website][HelpUpgrade].

Run
---

You have nothing to consider specially, simply navigate to your Pico install using your favorite web browser. Pico's default contents will explain how to use your brand new, stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS.

#### You don't have a web server?
Starting with PHP 5.4 the easiest way to try Pico is using [the built-in web server of PHP][PHPServer]. Please note that PHPs built-in web server is for development and testing purposes only!

###### Step 1
Navigate to Pico's installation directory using a shell.

###### Step 2
Start PHPs built-in web server:
```shell
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

###### Step 3
Access Pico from http://localhost:8080.
